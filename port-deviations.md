# reticulum-swift port deviations

All logic in this swift port mirrors `../Reticulum/RNS/` (python reference).
Any deviation from the python reference must be documented here with the
file:line, the python reference site, and the reason.

## Active deviations

### `ReticulumTransport.onInterfacePeerSpawned` / `onInterfaceConnected` (new feature)

**Sites:** `Sources/ReticulumSwift/Transport/ReticulumTransport.swift` —
`onInterfacePeerSpawned`, `onInterfaceConnected`, and their setters
`setOnInterfacePeerSpawned` / `setOnInterfaceConnected`.

**Python reference:** No equivalent. Python `RNS.Transport` has no app-layer
hook for "an interface was added" or "an interface reached connected." The
upstream pattern is for app code to inspect `RNS.Transport.interfaces`
directly or to register destinations and let the transport layer handle
discovery. Swift needs these hooks because the iOS app (Columba) has
lifecycle-driven UI state and per-interface announce policy that depends
on knowing precisely *when* an interface flips, distinguished by the
*kind* of trigger (peer-spawn on AutoInterface/BLE/MPC vs. state-change
on TCP/RNode/static).

**Reason:** Category (b) — new feature for the swift app surface. The
older single `onInterfaceAdded` callback (now wired as a deprecated shim)
fired from both kinds of trigger indistinguishably; the iOS app needs to
gate them independently behind separate user-facing settings
(`auto_announce_on_peer_spawned` vs `auto_announce_on_tcp_reconnect`).
